# [Pokedex](https://pokedex-joaoneiva.surge.sh/)

## About:
The "Pokedex - React and APIs" project aims to build a Pokémon website that uses a public API [Poke Api](https://pokeapi.co/ "Poke Api") as its data source and consists of three pages: Home, Pokedex, and Details, following the design provided in Figma.

## Functionalities:
- Integration of a public API with React, using axios to create endpoints that receives data based on the API's documentation.
- Navigation between pages with React Router.
- Implementation of global state management through React Context for better organization and maintenance of data among components, without using props.
- The project follows the proposed [design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KseyA2Ofghiek2Cy3ZaDre/Poked%C3%A9x?t=AEi3zEmWmarf1FbP-0 "design").
- Button to add or remove Pokémon from the Pokedex, with the restriction of not being able to add the same Pokémon twice.
